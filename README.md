## Data Deduplication for Secure and Efficient Cloud Storage 🌐

🚀 Project Overview
This project aims to optimize cloud storage by removing duplicate data, ensuring better security, efficiency, and cost-effectiveness. By implementing data deduplication combined with encryption and compression, the system guarantees seamless storage management, even in cloud environments like AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud.

Tech Stack: Java, AWT/Swing, MySQL, AWS, Google Cloud
Features: Cloud Integration, Deduplication, Encryption, Compression
Target Audience: Cloud service providers, system administrators, and developers

## 🎯 Key Features
🔐 User-Friendly Interface
Web-based Dashboard: Effortlessly manage your data and track deduplication status.
Log Tracking: Monitor the progress and history of deduplicated files.
Permissions Management: Easily control user access to different data sets.

## ⚙️ Automation at Its Best
Deduplication Automation: Automatically compares files, identifies blocks for deduplication, and encrypts them with minimal human intervention.
Dynamic Ownership Management: Simplifies access revocation and permission updates in the background.

## 🔒 Pre-Verified Access Control
Ensures only authorized users can upload or access data, backed by integration with systems like LDAP or OAuth for secure access.

## 🛡️ Efficient Encryption Mechanism
Uses convergent encryption, ensuring data deduplication works even on encrypted files.
Only unique blocks are encrypted, optimizing both security and performance.

## 📈 Scalable Storage
Supports large data uploads without sacrificing performance.
Automatically adjusts storage capacity with hybrid cloud architecture, ensuring scalability as storage needs grow.

## 🔑 Dynamic Ownership Management
Easily update or revoke data access permissions, ensuring secure collaboration.

## 🌍 Cross-Platform Compatibility
Accessible via web, mobile, or desktop platforms.
Integrates with AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud for seamless cloud storage management.
⚙️ Low Maintenance & Self-Monitoring
Includes self-monitoring capabilities for automatic alerts about potential issues, reducing the need for manual intervention.

## 💼 Security & Privacy Assurance
Built-in encryption, collusion resistance, and secure hashing ensure data safety and integrity.

## ⚡ Performance Optimization
Faster uploads with block-level deduplication and pre-upload checks.
Bandwidth savings due to storing only unique data blocks.

## 🖥️ Software Requirements
To run this project, you will need the following software:

 Operating System: Windows (Recommended)

🏗️ Getting Started
Prerequisites
Make sure to install the following software:

Java (JDK 8 or higher)
NetBeans IDE (Version 8.0)
MySQL (Version 5.0)
Installation
Clone the repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone <repository_url>
Open the project in NetBeans IDE and run the application.
Install dependencies:
Add necessary libraries like MySQL JDBC driver and encryption libraries.
Set up integration with cloud platforms, if required.
Set up Database:
Create a MySQL database.
