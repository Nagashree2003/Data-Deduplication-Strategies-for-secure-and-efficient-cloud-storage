Data Deduplication for Secure and Efficient Cloud Storage 
Project Overview
This project focuses on optimizing cloud storage by eliminating duplicate data. By implementing advanced algorithms for data deduplication, encryption, and access control, it significantly enhances storage efficiency, reduces operational costs, and ensures the security and integrity of user data. The system features a web-based dashboard for easy management, automation to handle tedious tasks, and scalability to meet growing data demands. The project is developed using Java and NetBeans IDE, with a focus on performance and ease of use for both administrators and users.

Features
1. User-Friendly Interface
The system provides an intuitive, web-based dashboard for administrators and users. It allows them to:

Monitor deduplication status: View the progress of deduplication and the total storage savings achieved.
View logs: Inspect logs of files that have been deduplicated and track changes in ownership.
Manage user permissions: Control data access, assign roles, and manage security policies to ensure proper data handling.
2. Automation of Processes
The deduplication process, including file comparison, block identification, and encryption, is fully automated. This minimizes the need for manual intervention, ensuring smoother operations. Additionally, dynamic ownership management and automatic access revocation are performed in the background, keeping the system secure and up-to-date.

3. Pre-Verified Access Control
Only authorized users can upload or access data, making it easier to maintain security. The project integrates with existing identity management systems (like LDAP and OAuth) for easy and secure user authentication. This reduces administrative burden while maintaining high levels of security.

4. Efficient Encryption Mechanism
To ensure that deduplication works effectively even with encrypted data, the system uses convergent encryption. This encryption scheme ensures that the same data blocks are always encrypted the same way, allowing deduplication to occur without compromising security. The system only encrypts unique data blocks, which reduces computational overhead and speeds up the upload process.

5. Scalable Storage
The platform is built to scale, supporting large-scale data uploads without sacrificing performance. By using a hybrid cloud architecture, the system dynamically adjusts to growing storage demands, ensuring the infrastructure can handle the increasing size of user data efficiently.

6. Dynamic Ownership Management
Ownership and access rights are dynamically managed. Users can update or revoke data access permissions easily. Changes in ownership are reflected immediately across the system, allowing for secure and collaborative data sharing.

7. Cross-Platform Compatibility
The project supports multiple devices and platforms, including web, mobile, and desktop. It also integrates seamlessly with popular cloud platforms such as AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud, offering flexibility in how and where users can interact with the system.

8. Low Maintenance Requirements
The system is designed with self-monitoring capabilities that alert administrators to potential issues. It requires minimal configuration when adding new users or datasets, ensuring ease of maintenance.

9. Security and Privacy Assurance
The project integrates a variety of security measures, including encryption, collusion resistance, and secure hashing. These features ensure that sensitive data remains protected and that unauthorized access is prevented. Users do not need to understand the technical details to benefit from these advanced security features.

10. Performance Optimization
The system includes performance-boosting features like block-level deduplication and pre-upload checks. These techniques help reduce upload times, save bandwidth, and optimize overall storage efficiency.

Software Requirements
Operating System:
Windows (Recommended for development and deployment)
Programming Language:
Java (JDK 8 or higher)
Frameworks:
Java AWT/Swing for building the graphical user interface (GUI).
Java-based libraries for encryption and compression (e.g., JCE for encryption, Apache Commons for compression).
Tools:
JDK 8: Java Development Kit (JDK) version 8.
NetBeans IDE 8.0: Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for Java development.
HeidiSQL: Database management tool for working with MySQL.
Database:
MySQL 5.0 Server: Relational database management system (RDBMS) used for data storage.
Getting Started
Prerequisites
Ensure the following software and tools are installed:

NetBeans IDE 8.0
Java Development Kit (JDK) 8
MySQL 5.0 Server and HeidiSQL for database management
Cloud Platform Account (AWS, Azure, Google Cloud) for integration
Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone <repository_url>
Open the project in NetBeans:

Launch NetBeans IDE.
Use File > Open Project to select the project folder.
Install necessary dependencies:

Ensure that all required libraries for the project are included in the project (e.g., MySQL JDBC driver, encryption libraries).
Configure access to cloud storage platforms (AWS, Azure, Google Cloud) if integration is required.
Set up the Database:

Create a MySQL database and configure the connection.
Use HeidiSQL to manage the database and import any required schema.
Start the application:

Right-click the project in NetBeans and select Run.
The application should open in a local web browser or can be deployed to a cloud platform.
Usage
Once the application is up and running, you can interact with the web-based dashboard via a browser. Key operations include:

Viewing deduplication status.
Monitoring storage savings.
Managing user permissions.
